# Machine Learning in Python

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the Data Mining and Modeling course, focused on machine learning. The code is organized by topic and includes tutorials and projects on machine learning algorithms, packages and applications.

### SVM sklearn Tutorial

This file contains an introductory tutorial on support vector machines using the scikit-learn package. The code covers the basics of SVM, and a demonstration using the classic iris dataset.

### Feature Selection sklearn Tutorial

In this notebook, different feature selection methods and their applications using relevant tools in the scikit-learn package are examined. The code covers popular feature selection techniques, such as SelectKBest and Recursive Feature Elimination, and demonstrates how they can be used to improve model performance. 

### Breast Cancer Data Analysis & Predictions

Traditional machine learning techniques were applied on various variables of a breast mass to predict whether it is malignant or benign. The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using techniques such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and decision trees. 

### Shark Species Prediction using Tensor Flow

In this notebook, an image-based deep nerual network model using TensorFlow package was trained to classify the Bull Sharks and Great White Sharks. he code covers data preparation, model construction and training, and performance evaluation. The project also includes a discussion of the importance of data quality to improve model accuracy.
